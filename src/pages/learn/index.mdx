                  The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA<sup>®</sup>) Program is
                  designed to equip candidates with the knowledge and skills
                  necessary to compete and excel in today’s complex and evolving
                  investment industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the most respected and sought-after designations in the
                  global finance and investment worlds, the CFA designation can
                  open doors to diverse career opportunities in investment
                  management, financial analysis, and portfolio management. The
                  CFA Program is typically completed by those with backgrounds
                  in finance, accounting, economics, or business but with the
                  evolution of the industry, more and more students with
                  backgrounds in math, computer science and even liberal arts
                  are joining the profession.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The CFA Program is ideal for undergraduate students with 23
                  months or fewer before graduating, candidates with a bachelors
                  degree looking to pursue a career in finance or people looking
                  to advance their career prospects as a financial advisor or
                  investment banker.
                </p>
                <p>
                  CFA charterholders are qualified to work in senior and
                  executive positions as an investment banker, financial
                  advisor, financial planner, and more.
